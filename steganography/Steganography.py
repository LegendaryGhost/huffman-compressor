        the modified grayscale values.

        - Convert the secret message into a binary string.
        - Open the image in RGB mode.
        - For each pixel selected (here, the first pixels up to the length of the binary message):
            - Compute its grayscale value using the luminance formula (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B).

            - Calculate the difference (delta) between the new and old grayscale value.
            - Adjust the original pixel channels by the delta (with clamping to keep values in 0â€“255).
